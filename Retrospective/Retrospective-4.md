TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 05)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 3/3
- Total points committed vs done: 34/34
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 95h / 97h30m
**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    2    |    -   |     45h    |      68h30m  |
|  14    |    1    |    13  |      5h    |      5h      |   
|  40    |    5    |    13  |     30h    |      8h      |
|  41    |    3    |    8   |     15h    |     16h      | 




- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) 
    average = 97h30m / 11 =  8h52m
    standard deviation = 346,96m 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table = 95h / 97h30m = 0,97

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing
  - Total hours estimated: 18h
  - Total hours spent: 32h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 186
  - Coverage: 62,8%
- E2E testing
  - Total hours estimated:22h 
  - Total hours spent: 33h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
- Technical Debt management
  - Total hours estimated 45h
  - Total hours spent 68h30m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube 4h55m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 0
  - Hours spent on remediation 1h
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") 0.1%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
    - reliability: A
    - security: A
    - security review: A
    - maintainability: A
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? This time  the only problem was related to the  additional story 1, that although we estimated 13 points it requires less time than expected.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
It's difficult to reach a good quality of the software. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? We increased the number of testing. 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? We were not able to reach the maximum level of coverage.  

- One thing you are proud of as a Team! 
We are proud of the team work and collaboration with ourselves.
ZERO DEFECTS FOUNDED BY THE OTHER TEAM.
